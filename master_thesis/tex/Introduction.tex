\chapter{Introduction}
\subsection{Notation}
When working with quantum chemistry simplify equations or in order to give a
better intuition on what is possible arithmethically. Therefore it is needed to
clarify what most of the different symbols and representations mean in this
subject. Following are most of the notations used through this paper. Further exceptions to the notation will be
clarified where needed througout the paper.
\paragraph{Operators, scalars, vectors and matrices}
In this text, we will be using objects called operators. These operators represent
certain operations applied to functions. We represent as $\hat{O}$ exchanging the letter
as needed.

Scalars are constants, or coefficients without variables. They will be referred with
lower case letters.

Vectors will be represented with lower case letters as $\vec{a}$, while
matrices will be represented with upper case as $\bar{A}$.
\paragraph{Order of operations}
Operators are applied from the left onto functions. Applying the operator
$\hat{O}$ and then operator $\hat{A}$ onto the function $\Psi(x)$ will be written as follows
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}\hat{O}\Psi(x)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{commutation}
Two operators $\hat{O}$ and $\hat{A}$ are said to commute if:
\begin{align}
  \hat{O}\hat{A} &= \hat{A}\hat{O} \\
  \hat{O}\hat{A} - \hat{A}\hat{O} &= 0\label{eq:commutation}
\end{align}
This operation is written with square brackets, e.g. the operation in \ref{eq:commutation} is
written as $[\hat{O},\hat{A}]$.

\paragraph{Dirac notation}
In this thesis we will be using Dirac notation for the most part. In this notation
the quantum state described by a wave function $\Psi$ is written as a state vector
$\ket{\Psi}$ \cite{Atkins:2011} called \textbf{ket}. Its complex conjugate is called
a \textbf{bra} and is written as $\bra{\Psi}$. We will interchange between this and standard notation
as needed, in order to give more clarity to the equations used.
The scalar product between a bra and a ket is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \braket{\Psi|\Psi} = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \Psi^{\star}\Psi dr \label{eq:diracscalpro}
\end{equation}
Where integration rules apply.

Two functions are orthonormal if:
\begin{equation}
    \braket{\Psi_i|\Psi_j} = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}
Where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta which equals one when $i = j$ and
zero when $ i \neq j$ \cite{Atkins:2011, Cohen:1973}.
